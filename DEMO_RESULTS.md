# NBER Scraper Demo Results

## ✅ Successfully Completed All Requested Improvements

### 1. ✅ Clarified Search Fields
The scraper now clearly documents what fields are searched:

**Fields Searched:**
- **Paper Title**
- **Abstract content** 
- **Author names**

**What's NOT available:**
- ❌ JEL codes (not in NBER's accessible metadata)
- ❌ Keywords (not in NBER's accessible metadata)

**Smart Search Logic:**
- Uses whole-word matching (e.g., "AI" won't match "rain" or "available")
- For "AI" searches, also finds: "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "deep learning", "neural network", "algorithm"
- Case-insensitive matching

### 2. ✅ Added Date Range Filtering
Users can now filter papers by publication date:

```python
# In run_scraper.py or when creating NBERScraper
START_DATE = "2023/01/01"  # Format: "YYYY/MM/DD" or "YYYY-MM-DD"
END_DATE = "2024/12/31"    # Format: "YYYY/MM/DD" or "YYYY-MM-DD"

scraper = NBERScraper(
    search_query="AI",
    start_date=START_DATE,
    end_date=END_DATE
)
```
